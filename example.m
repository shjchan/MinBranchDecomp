%    In 'example.mat', there are two structures:
% 
%    1. 'Cardiomyocyte' is the structure containing the first 10
%       optimal MBDs, 35 MinEFMDs and the problem structure that further 
%       contains the rediced network, the flux distribution and the EFM matrix. 
%       The original network data can be downloaded in the supplementary 
%       information of the paper:

% 
%     2. 'lactis' is the structure containing the first 10 optimal MBDs, 
%       and the 10 MinEFMDs compared in the paper and the problem structure 
%       that further contains the rediced network, the flux distribution 
%       and the EFM matrix. The original network data can be downloaded 
%       in the supplementary information of the paper:

%       Lactococcus lactis MG1363 and its application to the analysis of flavor
%       formation. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol., 97, 8729–39.
